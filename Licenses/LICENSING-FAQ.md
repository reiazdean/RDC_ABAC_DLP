📄 Licensing FAQ
This document answers common questions about the licensing model for , which is offered under a dual license structure:
•	Apache License 2.0 (open source)
•	Commercial License (enterprise use)
________________________________________
What does “dual licensed” mean?
It means you can choose between:
•	Apache 2.0 — free, open source, permissive
•	Commercial License — paid, with additional rights and support
You pick the license that fits your use case.
________________________________________
Can I use for free?
Yes.
The Apache 2.0 license allows free use, modification, and distribution, including in commercial products, as long as you comply with the license terms.
If you only need the open source version, you’re good to go.
________________________________________
When do I need a commercial license?
You need a commercial license if:
•	Your organization requires support, SLAs, or security guarantees
•	You need indemnification
•	You want long term support (LTS) releases
•	You need internal redistribution rights beyond Apache 2.0
•	You want access to enterprise only features (if applicable)
•	Your legal/compliance team requires a commercial agreement
Most enterprises fall into one of these categories.
________________________________________
Can I use in my company without paying?
Yes — as long as you use it under the Apache 2.0 license and do not require the additional rights or services provided by the commercial license.
Many companies start with Apache 2.0 and upgrade later.
________________________________________
Can I modify the source code?
Yes.
Apache 2.0 explicitly allows modification.
If you are a commercial customer, you may also modify the software under the commercial license for internal use.
________________________________________
Can I redistribute modified versions?
•	Open source users:
Yes, as long as you comply with Apache 2.0 (including NOTICE and attribution requirements).
•	Commercial customers:
You may redistribute internally within your organization.
External redistribution requires a separate agreement.
